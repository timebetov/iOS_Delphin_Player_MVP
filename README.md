# Delphin - Simple iOS Music Player application

## I used MVP pattern...
> Firstly, If you want to test my app, go ahead to /model/Song.swift and add your songs to "mockSongs" array.
> Secondly, go on to folder /Supporting Files/ and paste here your song files and your images of album to show in the centre of screen to /Assets.xcassets...

### In this application I had deal with following stuffs:
1. CALayer
2. CAAnimation
3. Core Graphics
4. AVAudioPlayer
5. Gestures -> specifically with UISwipe and UITap
6. Delegate
7. Timer

## Features
* Play / Pause / Stop / Next / Previous .. track.
* Here, main views is 'Player' page where you can swipe up and see the list of songs you have added...
* While playing, image in centre is rotates.
* Tap image to pause the song, and image rotating will stops too.
